# Skill eval report

8 skills, 6 models, 660 runs. Models are ordered from lowest to highest tier.
Each cell is the share of runs that passed within the skill's time budget; ✓ means it meets the skill's floor
(see each section), ✗ that it does not, · that the model was not run. Every case is run several times per
model (usually 3) to measure stability: a case is flaky when its repeats disagree, which the per-skill tables count. Numbers rest on small samples (9 to 27 runs
per cell): treat gaps of a few points as noise. Live sites drift, so rerun before relying on one result.

## How to read this

- A run passes when every scored assertion holds: the skill was loaded, the files or answer match the ground
  truth, and (for browser tasks) the page is really in the expected state. Slower than the budget counts as a failure.
- The baseline model must meet a skill's floor before other models are run (`scripts/run.sh`). A ⚠ marks a baseline
  that does not, which means the skill or its eval needs work before the other rows mean anything.
- "Lowest model meeting the floor" uses the model order in `models.yaml`, which is a judgment call, not a benchmark.
- Raw promptfoo results stay in `output/`; `npx promptfoo view` browses the evals run on this machine.
